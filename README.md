## Overview

Orion is a compact Spotify companion for the desktop. It runs as a native
Tauri app, shows the current track in small always-available layouts, and keeps
playback controls, settings, themes, and AI-assisted recommendations close at
hand.

The repository also contains the public website and documentation site.

## Policy

This project is intended for personal, non-commercial use.
Each user must register their own application with Spotify for Developers and configure their own Client ID. Each installation is operated by the respective user under their own Spotify Developer account.

## Features

- Spotify OAuth PKCE login with automatic token refresh
- Secure OS keyring storage for Spotify tokens and AI provider keys
- Compact player layouts with playback controls, progress, and track metadata
- Built-in themes plus a JSON-based Theme Studio for custom themes
- AI DJ chat for recommendations and playback-aware music prompts
- Provider settings for Spotify, YouTube Music, and AI services
- Native desktop shell powered by Tauri and Rust

## Architecture

- `apps/desktop`: Tauri 2 desktop app with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Rust.
- `apps/www`: Next.js site for the project website and downloads.
- `apps/docs`: Astro Starlight documentation site.
- Rust commands handle OAuth, local callback handling, keyring access, settings,
  and desktop integration.
- The renderer talks to Spotify and AI providers through typed clients and
  Tauri commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=20.19.0`
- pnpm `10.26.2`
- Rust toolchain with the platform-specific Tauri prerequisites
- Spotify Developer app Client ID for local development builds

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm desktop:dev
pnpm www:dev
pnpm docs:dev
```

On first desktop launch, Orion asks for a Spotify Client ID and starts the
browser-based OAuth flow.

## Security

Orion does not store Spotify tokens or AI API keys in plain text files.
Credentials are kept in the operating system credential store:

| Platform | Storage |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Credential Manager |
| macOS | Keychain |
| Linux | Secret Service |

Spotify authentication uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. Desktop/open-source builds
must not embed a Spotify Client Secret.
